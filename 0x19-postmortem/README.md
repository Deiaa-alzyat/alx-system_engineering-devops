Postmortem: Website Outage Due to Database Overload
Issue Summary
On March 15th, 2024, from 14:00 to 16:30 UTC, our main product website experienced a significant outage, impacting approximately 65% of our user base. Users encountered prolonged loading times, with many unable to access their dashboards or complete transactions. The service disruption was traced back to an overload of our primary database, caused by an inefficient query that was triggered by a recent feature deployment.
Timeline
•	14:00 UTC - Issue detected via automated monitoring alerts indicating high database load.
•	14:05 UTC - Initial investigation by on-call engineering team suggested a spike in web traffic, leading to increased database queries.
•	14:20 UTC - Customer support reported a surge in user complaints about website inaccessibility and performance issues.
•	14:30 UTC - Deeper analysis revealed that the issue was not related to web traffic but to specific database queries consuming excessive resources.
•	14:45 UTC - The recent feature deployment was identified as the potential cause. The team started reviewing recent changes to the database schema and queries.
•	15:00 UTC - Efforts to optimize the identified problematic query did not yield immediate relief; the decision was made to temporarily revert the recent feature deployment.
•	15:30 UTC - The feature rollback was completed, and the database load started to normalize.
•	16:00 UTC - Monitoring confirmed that performance was returning to expected levels. Incremental traffic was allowed back onto the site.
•	16:30 UTC - Full service was restored, and all users were able to access the site and its features without issues.
Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause was identified as an inefficient database query introduced with a new feature deployment. This query did not properly utilize indexes, leading to full table scans that overwhelmed the database under normal operation conditions. The resolution involved rolling back the recent changes to eliminate the problematic query. Following the rollback, the engineering team worked on optimizing the query to ensure it used indexes efficiently. The optimized query was tested extensively under load before being redeployed to production.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent a recurrence of this issue, we are taking the following steps:
•	Review and enhance our deployment procedures to include more comprehensive testing of database-related changes, focusing on performance under load.
•	Implement improved monitoring for specific database performance metrics to detect inefficiencies before they impact users.
•	Enhance our rollback procedures to ensure quicker response times for reverting problematic deployments.
•	Conduct a thorough review of recent database schema changes and queries introduced to identify any other potential inefficiencies.
Tasks:
1.	Patch the database server to the latest stable version to ensure performance improvements and bug fixes are applied.
2.	Add specific monitoring alerts for unusual database query patterns and resource utilization spikes.
3.	Update our deployment checklist to include a step for load testing major features, especially those involving significant database interactions.
4.	Schedule a training session for the engineering team on advanced database performance optimization techniques.
By addressing these areas, we aim to significantly reduce the likelihood of similar outages in the future and ensure a more resilient and reliable service for our users.
